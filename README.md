# Parametric Curve Fitting for Trend Analysis

For many use cases that involve time series data, the ability to correctly infer the trend within the data can translate to business value. This repository uses Covid19 cases data and demonstrates the use of parametric curve fitting methods (e.g. polynomial functions, additive regression models).

<!-- ## TODOs

Initial high level list of tasks: 

- [ ] Data exploration: Explore interesting data insights, data transformation tasks etc 
- [ ] Model Training: Explore a set of models, automated hyperparameter search, distributed training, model evaluation etc
- [ ] Model Serving: Promoting good models to production, serving predictions over an api enddpoint 
- [ ] Front end: User interface for exploring predictions. -->
